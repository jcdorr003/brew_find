### MVP/PostMVP - 5min



#### MVP
- use Open Brewery DB API
- Render data on page when user clicks on link or inters text into input
- Allow the user to easily interact with site as well as look visually appealing

#### PostMVP EXAMPLE
- Style the home page to make it as visually appealing as possibilities
- Make the API call pull data for all states and style the website accordingly 

## React Component Hierarchy

In my app I will have 6 react components.

## Components
##### Writing out your components and its descriptions isn't a required part of the proposal but can be helpful.

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into stateless/stateful components.

| Component | Description |
| --- | :---: |  
| App | This will make the initial data pull and include React Router|
| Header | This will render the header include the nav |
| Footer | This will render the header include the nav |
| Main | This will have routes to Home, BrewerySearch, and Faves components |
| Home | This will have a welcome message and explain what the website does |
| BrewerySearch | This will include the input and lists of states for the user to search for breweries |
| Faves | This will contain all the favorites that the user clicks on to save |


Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Also, put a gif at the top of your Readme before you pitch, and you'll get a panda prize.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Adding Form | H | 3hrs| 3.5hrs | 3.5hrs |
| Working with API | H | 3hrs| 2.5hrs | 2.5hrs |
| Total | H | 6hrs| 5hrs | 5hrs |

## Additional Libraries
 I will be using axios to do my API call.
